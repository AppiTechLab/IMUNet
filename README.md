# IMUNet

This is the Python implementation for the Paper: archive
A new Architecture called IMUNet which is appropriate for edge-device implementation has been proposed for processing IMU meausrements and performing inertial navigation. 

In this reposirory, the data-driven method for inertial navigation proposed in https://github.com/Sachini/ronin for ResNet18 model has been modified.
Other than ResNet18, four state-of-the-art CNN models that have been designed for IoT device implementation have been reimplemented for inertial navigation and IMU sensor processing. . Two datasets are Px4 and OXIOD dataset. The other dataset has been collected using an android application and the ArCore API for collecting the ground truth using the SLAM technique. M

The Android Application is available at https://github.com/BehnamZeinali/IMUNet_Android.git
This is the Android implementation of the proposed architecture:
